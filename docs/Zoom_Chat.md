## Why use Kintone?
+ Super easy to use database / backend solution
+ You can use vanilla JS to build customizations right on the platform
+ Companies are hiring engineers to build Kintone integrations

## Compile and upload the code to Kintone

1. npm run build
1. npm run upload

=   =   =   =   =   =   =   =   =   =

## Where to get the Subdomain, View ID, and App ID?

Go to your Kintone App's custom view & grab the URL
Kintone App's URL follows this template:
https://<SUBDOMAIN>.kintone.com/k/<App ID>/?view=<View ID>
Example:

https://example.kintone.com/k/1/
Subdomain = example
KINTONE_BASE_URL = https://example.kintone.com
App ID = 1

=   =   =   =   =   =   =   =   =   =

## Live on YouTube

If you get lost, you can "rewind" on our lives stream on YouTube:
https://youtube.com/live/INSERT_YOUTUBE_LINK

=   =   =   =   =   =   =   =   =   =

Direct Message with your email address if you forgot your Kintone Subdomain

=   =   =   =   =   =   =   =   =   =

The KINTONE_BASE_URL variable is based on your subdomain.

For example:
Subdomain = example
KINTONE_BASE_URL = https://example.kintone.com

=   =   =   =   =   =   =   =   =   =
